# Project 2

Web Programming with Python and JavaScript: Build an online messaging service using Flask. Users will be able to sign into the site with a display name, create channels (i.e. chatrooms) to communicate in, as well as see and join existing channels. Once a channel is selected, users will be able to send and receive messages with one another in real time. 

Files:  
application.py: Flask application file.  
helpers.py: Python file with helper functions used in application.py.  
requirements.txt: Python packages that need to be installed in order to run this web application.

Install packages:  
$ pip install -r requirements.txt

ENV Variables:  
$ export FLASK_APP = application.py  
$ export SECRET_KEY = SECRET_KEY
